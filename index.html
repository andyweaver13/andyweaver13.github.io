      <h2>About</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>I'm taking my first Web Programming class this semester and I thought it would be fun to write my own HTML webiste from scratch to display some of my projects and see my Web Development skills grow throughout the semester. I will be periodically updating this website as the semester progresses to display the new skills I learn.</p>

        <h3>Breeze IOS App (in progress):</h3>
        <p>My roommate and I came up with the idea for Breeze when talking with our friends about their difficulties finding off-campus housing. We realized that there is no single platform to facilitate college students finding both housing and other college students to live with. Breeze is our idea of a solution to that problem.</p>

        <h4>Profile Tab</h4>
        <img class="breeze-pics" src="Images/BreezeProfileTab.png" alt="Breeze Profile Tab">
        <p>I created the profile tab to serve as the social media aspect of the app. It allows users to link their Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook accounts as well as listing basic information about themselves and their housing preferences (e.g. House or Appartment).</p>
        <img class="breeze-pics" src="Images/EditProfile.png" alt="Edit Profile Screen">
        <p>This is our 'Edit Profile' tab which allows the user to edit their information and profile picture.</p>
        <img class="breeze-pics" src="Images/SettingsScreen.png" alt="Settings Screen">
        <p>The settings screen is not yet functional, however this is a rough framework of how we would like it to look.</p>
