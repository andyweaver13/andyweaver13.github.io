      <hr>
      <p>I'm taking my first Web Programming class this semester and I thought it would be fun to write my own HTML webiste from scratch to display some of my projects and see my Web Development skills grow throughout the semester. I will be periodically updating this website as the semester progresses to display the new skills I learn.</p>

        <h3>Breeze IOS App (in progress):</h3>
        <p>My roommate and I came up with the idea for Breeze when talking with our friends about their difficulties finding off-campus housing. We realized that there is no single platform to facilitate college students finding both housing and other college students to live with. Breeze is our idea of a solution to that problem.</p>
